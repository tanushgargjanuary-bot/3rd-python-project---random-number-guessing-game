# 3rd-python-project---random-number-guessing-game
Another embarrasing project, uploading publicly as its helping me stay consistent. This one took 2 whole days cuz of college.
The goal: The user will keep guessing, program will show if the guess is lower, higher or same, and counter value will increase, until the user gets the correct guess, it'll be shown to user as Win, and the counter will print the number of guesses.
NOTE:- This could be modified and gretly enhancing user experience, but I spent too much time on this. And the modifications wont teach me a lot.

What I learned :-
import random, 
Realised that I can just make 1 function with guess and checking, and call that function, 
Putting counter inside function, before and after the loop, and how it would affect program, 
learned where to put the loop, as it wasnt obvious enough for me that it would be for almost whole function but not counter.
